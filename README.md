15 Game with A* algorithm

This is a game made in my Software Design class from Spring 21. 

This is a 15 game in which I made using javafx and compiled using Maven. The game also uses an A* algroithm as an AI to give hints to the next moves to complete the puzzle. A* algorithm was NOT coded by me, but everything else is. A* algorithm goes to my professor Mark Hallenback.
