15 Game with A* algorithm

This is a game made in my Software Design class from Spring 21. 

This is a 15 game in which I made using javafx and compiled using Maven. The game also uses an A* algorithm as an AI to give hints to the next moves to complete the puzzle. A* algorithm and implementation with nodes to find solution was not coded by me. Credit goes to my professor Mark Hallenback. Game itself is made by me.
